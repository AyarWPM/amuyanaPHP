AmuyañaPHP is the web version for the [Amuyaña](https://github.com/AyarWPM/amuyana) project which is written in Java and JavaFX.

## Live version

Enter to [amuyaña.net](http://app.amuyana.net/) to see the app in action.

## How to install in local server

Simply extract all the content in your local host folder, then open index.php in the web browser.

## Usage

The final purpose of Amuyaña is to visualize the structure of concepts and the phenomena given by a theory, it is a tool to develop scientific methodologies of research.

The novelty of the program is that it applies the Contradictory Logic developped by Stéphane Lupasco in 1951 ("Le Principe d'Antagonisme et la Logique de l'Énergie"). It renders a visual representation of the Table of deductions which is the main tool used in this Logic to stablish the causalities at play between the notions.

AmuyañaPHP can only display the information which has been created with the Java version [amuyaña](https://github.com/AyarWPM/amuyana). In future versions it should be possible to use the web version to add information to the database.
